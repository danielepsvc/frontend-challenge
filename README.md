# Frontend challenge
Creation of three simple layouts using HTML, Bootstrap 5 and SCSS and a bit of javascript for basic navigation. Layouts should be responsive and optimized for larger devices, such as HD, Full HD, and 4k monitors.

# Resolutions reference

HD `1366 x 768`

Full HD  `1920 x 1080`

4K `3840 x 2160`

# Requirements
`Node.js` `Express` `EJS`

# üõ† Installation & Set Up

## Step 1: Download Node

[Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and follow the guided prompts until the installation is complete.
You can validate Node was successfully installed by navigating to the command line and entering the following command.
```
node -v 
npm -v
```
If installed correctly, you will see the version of Node returned.

*Wait‚Ä¶ What is npm?*

Great question! Npm (node package manager) is the default package manager for Node that hosts thousands of packages for free. Don‚Äôt worry; npm was automatically installed when you downloaded Node!

## Step 2: Clone Git Repo

Download this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/danielepsvc/frontend-challenge.git
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

First go into project folder by using the command

```
cd frontend-challenge
```

Then install project dependencies with 

```
npm install 
```

This will install Express and EJS 

*What is Express ?*

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.


*And EJS...*

EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

# üöÄ Building and Running 

## Step 1: Launch Your Server

You are almost there! Go to the command line and enter the following in order to launch your server:

```
node app.js
```

You will know your server is running correctly if your terminal returns the ‚ÄúServer is listening on port 8080‚Äù message written the ‚Äúapp.js‚Äù file.

```
console.log('Server is listening on port 8080');
```

## Step 2: Check it out!

Finally, go to Chrome and enter ‚Äúlocalhost:8080‚Äù in your browser.
You did it!

# Recap

Congratulations! You now have a solid understanding of how to build and test your web applications on a localhost server using Node and Express.
